    <h2 >Plot</h2>
    <p>Moe Sat May's mother has passed away. One day, Moe Sat May's father remarries to a woman whom he doesn't love. The girl's name is Ah Mone (translation in English is “hate”) and she is younger than Moe Sat May. Moe Sat May can't protest her father’s decision because she is scared of him.
         At first, she is angry towards Ah Mone. Eventually, Moe Sat May comes to understand and feel pity for Ah Mone.
         She and her friend Garmani help Ah Mone. Moe Sat May loves her friend Garmani, but she is too shy to confess her feelings. One day, 
         Moe Sat May's father becomes crippled and Ah Mone takes good care of her husband. At the end of the film, Garmani and Moe Sat May get married,
          and Moe Sat May's father and Ah Mone became the grandpa and grandma of Garmani and Moe Sat May's children.</p>

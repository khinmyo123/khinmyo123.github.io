    <p class="header-septwo">Many flowering plants reflect as much light as possible within the range of visible 
        wavelengths of the pollinator the plant intends to attract. 
        Flowers that reflect the full range of visible light are generally perceived as white by a human observer. 
        An important feature of white flowers 
        is that they reflect equally.

        Many flowering plants reflect as much light as possible within the range of visible wavelengths of the pollinator the plant intends to attract.
         Flowers that reflect the full range of visible light are generally perceived as white by a human observer. An important feature of white flowers 
         is that they reflect equally across the visible spectrum. While many flowering plants use white to attract pollinators, the use of color is also
          widespread even within the same species. Color allows a flowering plant to be more specific about the pollinator it seeks to attract.
           The color model used by human color reproduction technology relies on the modulation of pigments that divide the spectrum into broad areas 
           of absorption.Flowering plants by contrast are able to shift the transition point wavelength between absorption and reflection.</p>
           <div>The flower-giving tradition goes back to prehistoric times when flowers often had a medicinal and herbal attributes. Archaeologists found in several grave sites remnants of flower petals. 
               Flowers were first used as sacrificial and burial objects.</div>

                <p>flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the 
                    division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). 
                    The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union.</p><br>
